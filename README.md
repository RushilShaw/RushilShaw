# Rushil Shah's Github

Hello! Welcome to my Github. Check out all of my cool projects that I work on in my free time. I'm a Computer Engineering student at Purdue University with a passion for software engineering and technology. I am a driven individual with a desire to learn and grow in the field of computer science and tech. I am currently seeking a summer internship that converts into a full time job for the Summer of 2024.

## Education

I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Purdue University and expect to graduate in May 2025. I have been on the Dean's List/Semester Honors. My learning community at Purdue is "Engineering in the World of Data," where I  worked as a teaching assistant during my Sophomore year. Before Purdue, I graduated from Walton High School in 2021 with Honors.

## Work Experience

This past summer, I worked as an Engineering Intern at Stellantis/Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, I worked on the Software-X Team, focusing on testing for AI in self-driving vehicles. I enhanced regression methods for  infotainment systems on Masarati vehicals by integrating with the CAN bus network, reverse image detection, and HMI scripting. Additionally, I optimized route generation by 30% using Python and data science tools, and developed six hardware interfacing scripts to streamline automation and reduce engineers' workload.

The year before that I worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Genuine Parts Company, where I developed an Android application using Python and Kotlin, built the application using Android Studios and Jetpack Compose, utilizing Google Cloud Function/Google Firestore to manage inventory at NAPA store locations.

## Leadership

I am a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Electrical Team, where I work with the team to design, evaluate, build, and test the circuitry of remote-controlled submarines designed by ASME Small-Projects. I have also been a Chairman's Coach for Walton Robotics, where I co-wrote a published book that included infographics and data visualizations, wrote Java and Python code used for motor control and motor correction on a competition-ready robot, and drafted and gave yearly presentations outlining overall strategy at each competition.

## Skills

I have experience in various programming languages such as Python, Java, C, Kotlin, C#, JavaScript, and Swift. I also have experience in software tools such as Figma, Microsoft Office, and AutoCAD/Inventor.

## Hobbies

Every Summer I play in local tennis league (Ultimate Tennis), I am a UTR 4. I also had the wonderful oppertunity to attend the US Open this year.

I like playing chess (ELO 1200) and have been playing since kindergarden.

My favorite place to go is Park City, Utah where I have a great time snowboard and hit the slopes almost every year.

I am also a member of Purdue Sailing Club. BOILERUP!!
