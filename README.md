Hello! Welcome to my Github. Check out all of my cool projects that I work on in my free time. I'm a Computer Engineering student at Purdue University with a passion for software engineering and technology. I am a driven individual with a desire to learn and grow in the field of computer science and tech. ~~I am currently seeking a summer internship where I can apply my knowledge and skills to work with a team of experienced engineers~~. I am happy to say that I am working with Stellantis/Fiat Crystler Automotive the summer of 2023.

## Education

I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from Purdue University and expect to graduate in May 2025. I have been on the Dean's List/Semester Honors. My learning community at Purdue is "Engineering in the World of Data," where I then worked as a teaching assistant after my freshman year. Before Purdue, I graduated from Walton High School in 2021 where I graduated with Honors.

## Work Experience

I previously worked as a Software Engineering Intern at Genuine Parts Company, where I developed an Android application using Python and Kotlin, built the application using Android Studios and Jetpack Compose, utilizing Google Cloud Function/Google Firestore to manage inventory at NAPA store locations.

This summer, I will be working as an Engineering Intern at Stellantis/Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, where I will be working with various professional teams on computer engineering-related projects.

## Leadership

I am a member of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Electrical Team, where I work with the team to design, evaluate, build, and test the circuitry of remote-controlled submarines designed by ASME Small-Projects. I have also been a Chairman's Coach for Walton Robotics, where I co-wrote a published book that included infographics and data visualizations, wrote Java and Python code used for motor control and motor correction on a competition-ready robot, and drafted and gave yearly presentations outlining overall strategy at each competition.

## Skills

I have experience in various programming languages such as Python, Java, C, Kotlin, C#, JavaScript, and Swift. I also have experience in software tools such as Figma, Microsoft Office, and AutoCAD/Inventor.

## Hobbies

I play in my local tennis league every summer, and had the wonderful oppertunity to attend the US Open this year.

I like playing chess and have been playing since kindergarden.

My favorite place to go is Park City, Utah where I have a great time snowboard and hit the slopes almost every year.
